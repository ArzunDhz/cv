      An “About Me,” also known as a blurb, is a short piece of writing that informs your reader about your professional background, key accomplishments, personal values and any brands you may be associated with. Personal websites, social media
      profiles and company directories often feature “About Me” sections. A blurb is an opportunity to quickly give important details about yourself to potential business contacts like clients, vendors, employers or anyone who wants to get to know
      you
      better.

      “About Me” writings can vary in length, tone, content and point of view. For example, a social media blurb might be shorter, more informal and written with first-person “I” statements. Blurbs for a company website might include more details,
      use
      a professional tone and show your full name. However, you have a lot of freedom in choosing the length and style of your “About Me.”

      Blurbs are important because they quickly give potential business contacts the most relevant information about you. Because an “About Me” can be less formal than a candidate profile on a resume, it can also be a chance to use humor or a
      personal
      story to help the reader become familiar with you.
